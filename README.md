## Issues I had were overwriting Bootstrap NAV link so I could add a hamburger menu. Also, I could not figure out how to get the grey background to move accross the entire website for the second row... This was a hard assignment for me. I do not know if it was trying to master HTML5 still or what but it seemed everytime I would expect one outcome something else was messed up. For the mixins, I understand the concept and will use it but this website page really didn't give me the opportunity to use it, so I had to kindof force a way to use it by using a class and id on links so I could use a mixins for the class. Also, the nesting was quite helpful to make the code shorter. However, I did not make it really small and kept the code normal because I do not feel advanced enough for that.
